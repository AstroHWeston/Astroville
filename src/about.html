<h2> Who is this guy bro </h2>
<pre>
	Hi, I'm Astro. I am active in many online communities, most notably Quantum Science Inc, a Roblox Sci-fi group.
	I do programming in my free time. I class myself as a back-end developer, however, as you can see, I can do some front-end work as well... If I actually care enough to do something.
	Furthermore, I have recently started getting into, and developing my skills in cryptography and steganography.
</pre>

<h2> How can I get in touch with bro? </h2>
<pre>
	I have many points of contacts. I usually use discord to communicate with everyone, however I do have a public email as well.
	My discord username is <b>astrohweston</b>. You can find most of my socials there.
	My email is <b>me@astrohweston.xyz</b>.
